# **App Name**: Celestial Clock

## Core Features:

- Time-Based Icon Display: Display a sun/moon icon based on the user's local time. The icon's position should reflect the time of day, moving along a curved path.
- Animated Transition: Dynamically update the sun/moon icon's position and appearance based on the current time. Transitions between sun and moon should be smooth and visually appealing.
- Timezone Detection: Automatically detect the user's timezone to accurately reflect the time of day in the animation.

## Style Guidelines:

- Daytime colors: Bright yellow (#FFDA63) for the sun and light blue (#E0F2F7) for the sky.
- Nighttime colors: Dark blue (#2C3E50) for the moon and a starry dark background.
- Accent: Soft gradient transitions between day and night colors.
- The sun/moon animation should be placed in the background, not obstructing the main content.
- Smooth transitions between the sun and moon phases, as well as the background colors.
- Use a simple, elegant sun and moon icon design.
